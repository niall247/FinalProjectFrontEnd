# Research Project 6CC552 
This is the front end code developed for consideration as part of the Final Research project on developing an Inclusive Mobile Travel Application.

There are three core Projects :-

1. CityGuide - This is the cross platform code, and in effect the main code in an MVVM pattern as well as custom controls.
2. CityGuide.IOS - This is code required by the IOS platform to interact with the main code base. Most of this is out the box, but there are a few key items, such as the FileAccessHelper in order to prepare the local SQLite database and copy it to the client phone.
3. CityGuide.Tests - these are the unit tests referred to in the project under the heading 'Unit Testing'. There are 133 of them.

This application was developed and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for Mac with Xamarin Forms.
